This retrieves the artwork of embedded Vimeo, YouTube, Dailymotion, SoundCloud, Mixcloud, Bandcamp player widget and puts them in the meta-tags.

== Description ==

This plugin adds several OpenGraph meta-tags to the header of your theme. These include site name, a description (the excerpt of a post), the permalink, and images for embedded media widgets. The images will be retrieved from the audio player embedded in your post ("cover artwork") or snapshots from embedded videos.

Currently, these widgets are supported:

*  SoundCloud (HTML5 and Flash), single tracks and albums
*  Mixcloud (APIv2 players)
*  Bandcamp, single tracks and albums - requires valid Bandcamp API key!
*  Vimeo (embed and iframe players)
*  YouTube (embed and iframe players)
*  DailyMotion

OpenGraph tags will be used by social-media sites such as Facebook or Google+ to style a shared link or webpages "liked" by any user. As images attract more attention, you will hopeful find this plug-in useful.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder `meta-ographr` with all its contents to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Review the preferences to make use of all features

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why doesn't Facebook display the cover artwork? =

Facebook caches previously submitted links for an undisclosed time. If your post has been shared/liked on Facebook before, the cover artwork will not appear until the cache has expired. To make sure the plugin is active and working, you can always look for the og:image tags in the source of your post.

= I don't use social media, why would I use this? =

People share links with their friends on social media sites whether you like it or not. This plug-in gives you some control over how your content is presented on platforms such as Facebook and Google+. Displaying cover artwork or video snapshots with your link usually looks nicer and attracts the attention of potential visitors.

= Do I need a SoundCloud API key? =

No. By default this plug-in uses its own registered API key, but if you prefer -for whatever reason- to use your own,
you can easily do so.

= Why do I need a Bandcamp API key? =

Bandcamp is rather restrictive with access to their API, usually only allowing access to owners of material hosted on
their platform. In order to get an API key, you have to apply via email.
